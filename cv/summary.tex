\begin{cvparagraph}
MSc Computer Science graduate from Bar-Ilan University and former IDF officer with 5+ years of R\&D experience in Unit 8200.
My academic journey began early, \textbf{completing my BSc during high school} and advancing to an MSc with \textbf{multiple publications in SODA, a valued peer-reviewed conference}. I presented my work at these international conferences. 
This academic foundation complements my extensive experience in Unit 8200, where I designed several systems, led critical cyber projects, recruited for `ARAM`, and \textbf{built a new security team of engineers from the ground up}.
I was recently discharged and am now continuing my PhD full-time, where I research various algorithms for distance-related problems.
% developed novel algorithms, applied cutting-edge machine learning techniques, led critical projects, and \textbf{built a new research team of engineers from the ground up}. Recently, I joined a stealth startup as a core team member, where I wear multiple hats, spanning research, AI solution implementation, and development.
% MSc Physics graduate from Tel Aviv University and former IDF officer with 4+ years of R\&D experience in Unit 8200. My academic journey began early, \textbf{completing my BSc during high school} and advancing to an MSc with \textbf{multiple publications in peer-reviewed journals, garnering over 200 citations}, and presented my work at multiple international conferences. This academic foundation complements my extensive experience in Unit 8200, where I developed novel algorithms, applied cutting-edge machine learning techniques, led critical projects, and \textbf{built a new research team of engineers from the ground up}. I thrive in high-paced, dynamic working environments and excel at rapidly adapting and mastering new domains. Now seeking a challenging position as an algorithm developer where I could leverage my skills to solve interesting problems.
